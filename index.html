    <img src="images/FilmsImpactSociety.jpg" alt="Films impact on Society" id="image">
    <p>There’s no question that watching films can help us escape our everyday lives. However, all kinds of films impact our society and popular culture in many different ways all over the world. Studies have shown that many people believe that cops may sometimes break the law in order to enforce it and they are quite okay with this. There have been several cases where by suspects have been bitten up until they confessed to crimes they did not commit leaving    out the true criminals,but doesn’t this turn them into the very criminals we entrusted them to put behind bars.
     Films such as ‘Cops’ which was a popular American Tv show was recently canceled due to the black lives matter movement as it glorified police brutality especially  towards people of color. </p>
    <p>Films however do also have a positive effect on society mainly sci-fi movies and series.Most of them act as a warning against global problems that are seeded deep within our siciety and others which we ignore such as global warming.Films such as ‘Alterd Carbon” depict how immoral and inhuman a society can possibly be without proper authority . </p>
